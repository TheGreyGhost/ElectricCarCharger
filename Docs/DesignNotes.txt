Current sensor

Contactor for

Position switch

Keypad

Pins:
Use a PICAXE 14M2
B.3, B.4 = hi2c for LCD display
B.1, B.2 = keypad buttons serial clock & data

C.4 ADC = current sensor (use an inductive current sensor with an averaging circuit)

C.3 = RS485_IN
C.2 = RS485_OUT
C.1 = RS485_DIR
Could I use B.0 and B.1 for hserin, hserout instead?

C.0 = contactor control

Also need:
One or more status LEDs -
waiting to charge
blinking while charging
time wait

to edit a param: * then digit


Out to an LED panel? i2c?
Keypad i2c? - have XC4602 https://www.jaycar.com.au/medias/sys_master/images/images/9630070439966/XC4602-dataSheetMain.pdf which is serial and clock but dedicated.
Realtime clock XC-4450
